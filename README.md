# NTU TimeTable UWP App

As the STARS Planner and STARS is way too **ugly** for me. I designed this good looking timetable display app just for a pleasant viewing experience

We already have a lot of stressful courses why not make the timetable look nicer and pleasing.

## Feature:

Fluent Desgin Language
Virbrant Colors
Display only the course u have in **CURRENT WEEK** 


## INSTALLATION:

The app doesnot connect the Internet so no privacy issue, it is a **UWP app** thus is much more safer than an **.exe app**

Download this release and unzip and follow instruction
Minimum System Requirements: **Windows 10 Version 1803 (10.0; Build 10.0.17134.0)**
