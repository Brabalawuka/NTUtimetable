# NTU TimeTable UWP App

As the STARS Planner and STARS is way too **ugly** for me. I designed this good looking timetable display app just for a pleasant viewing experience

We already have a lot of stressful courses why not make the timetable look nicer and pleasing.

Fluent Desgin Language  
Virbrant Colors

## PRIVACY:

The app doesnot connect the Internet so no privacy issue, it is a offline **UWP app** thus is cleaner and saher than an **.exe app**
